Indeed, microbes in and on the body outnumber human cells about 10 to one.<br /><br />\\u201cYou are a minority party in the democracy of the body,\\u201d Dr. Mason said.<br /><br />&quot;The body\\u2019s collection of microbes, called the microbiome, influences health in ways that researchers are only beginning to understand. They may be key to proper digestion, vitamin synthesis and brain function, new research suggests. Changes among the millions of microbes living in the human stomach also may promote obesity, trigger ulcers or affect how well a flu vaccine works.&quot;<br /><br />The article describes a research project to explore signs of this microbiome expressed on surfaces throughout the NYC subways.<br /><br />My two favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\u201cA city is like an organism,\\u201d said IBM Corp. computational biologist Robert Prill, who is among those at the company investigating ways to better collect and analyze these immense new public-health genome databases. \\u201cIt has a circulating system consisting of the movement of people.\\u201d<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\u201cWe know next to nothing about the ecology of urban environments,\\u201d said evolutionary biologist Jonathan Eisen at the University of California at Davis. \\u201cHow will we know if there is something abnormal if we don\\u2019t know what normal is?\\u201d\\ufeff\", \n",

      "    \"content\": \"This was my favorite piece in this Sunday&#39;s New York Times. It&#39;s a fascinating article about CBW, a tiny bank in Kansas, that has become a laboratory for financial innovation with a focus on better user experience.<br /><br />&quot;The creation of the new bank, and the maintenance of the old one, are the work of a couple who were born in India and ended up in Kansas after living in Silicon Valley and passing through jobs at Google and Lehman Brothers....<br /><br />&quot;Their work is an unusual experiment: a new kind of mom-and-pop business trying to reshape a highly regulated and innovation-resistant industry. The new services that CBW is providing, like instant payments to any bank in the United States, direct remittance transfers abroad and specialized debit cards, might seem as if they should be painless upgrades in an age of high-frequency trading and interplanetary space missions. But with most banks, it still takes longer to send money to another country or even to another state than it does to travel the same distance.&quot;<br /><br />I was particularly struck by this paragraph, which reminded me of the fundamental game plan that we practice on government with the Code for America Fellowship:<br /><br />&quot;As he and his wife had hoped, buying an established institution allowed them to examine how money transfers and payment technology worked in a traditional bank \\u2014 something that was hard to see in detail from the outside \\u2014 and to consider how to make changes.<br /><br />&quot;His first discovery was that nearly all banks rely on a few big, and not terribly agile, outside vendors to provide all the software that makes bank computer systems work. Mr. Ramamurthi found a small technology provider that would be more flexible and allow him to begin tweaking the software....&quot;<br /><br />Get inside, figure out how it works now. Then start to iterate towards change, making the institution more flexible, and able to meet real user needs.\\ufeff\", \n",

If it were consistent with the Obama open data guidance, that RFP would require an API so that independent companies could provide alternate interfaces, just like travel sites provide booking interfaces for air travel, hotels, and more.\\u00a0<br /><br />Unfortunately, as drafted, the RFP allows the winning contractor to determine whether an API is feasible \\u2014 meaning the company that benefits most from keeping all the reservations to itself \\u00a0has the authority to do so. And the draft even removes data that is currently accessible \\u2014 availability data \\u2014 from public sharing. So, it\\u2019s a huge step backward, and completely out of step with the administration\\u2019s open data policy.<br /><br />The founder of Hipcamp, Alyssa Ravasio, has written up some thoughts on how this RFP could be improved that I want to share with you. And after reading them, I\\u2019m hoping you will be moved to send comments asking the Department of the Interior to reconsider their RFP.<br /><br />Comments on this draft are accepted via email to jasonmking@fs.fed.us through Wednesday October 22.

      "    \"content\": \"<b>Can We Use Data to Make Better Regulations?</b><br /><br />Evgeny Morozov either misunderstands or misrepresents the key point of my piece on Algorithmic Regulation. \\u00a0In his recent New Yorker article about big data and regulation, he summarizes my view as &quot;collect as much relevant data from as many sources as possible, analyze them in real time, and make an optimal decision based on the current circumstances rather than on some idealized projection.&quot;<br /><br />In fact, my article is about building regulations that do a <b>better job</b> of achieving their \\u00a0long term idealized outcome! \\u00a0Morozov has \\u00a0got it precisely backwards.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what I actually said on the subject. \\u00a0The article opens:<br /><br />&quot;Regulation is the bugaboo of today\\u2019s politics. We have too much of it in most areas, we have too little of it in others, but mostly, we just have the wrong kind, a mountain of paper rules, inefficient processes, and little ability to adjust the rules or the processes when we discover the inevitable unintended results.<br /><br />&quot;Consider, for a moment, regulation in a broader context. Your car\\u2019s electronics regulate the fuel-air mix in the engine to find an optimal balance of fuel efficiency and minimal emissions. An airplane\\u2019s autopilot regulates the countless factors required to keep that plane aloft and heading in the right direction. Credit card companies monitor and regulate charges to detect fraud and keep you under your credit limit. Doctors regulate the dosage of the medicine they give us, sometimes loosely, sometimes with exquisite care, as with the chemotherapy required to kill cancer cells while keeping normal cells alive, or with the anesthesia that keeps us unconscious during surgery while keeping vital processes going. ISPs and corporate mail systems regulate the mail that reaches us, filtering out spam and malware to the best of their ability. Search engines regulate the results and advertisements they serve up to us, doing their best to give us more of what we want to see.<br /><br />&quot;What do all these forms of regulation have in common?<br /><br />&quot;A deep understanding of the desired outcome<br /><br />&quot;Real-time measurement to determine if that outcome is being achieved<br /><br />&quot;Algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that make adjustments based on new data<br /><br />&quot;Periodic, deeper analysis of whether the algorithms themselves are correct and performing as expected.<br /><br />&quot;There are a few cases\\u2014all too few\\u2014in which governments and quasi-governmental agencies regulate using processes similar to those outlined above. Probably the best example is the way that central banks regulate the money supply in an attempt to manage interest rates, inflation, and the overall state of the economy. Surprisingly, while individual groups might prefer the US Federal Reserve to tighten or loosen the money supply at a different time or rate than they do, most accept the need for this kind of regulation.<br /><br />&quot;Why is this?<br /><br />&quot;The desired outcomes are clear<br /><br />&quot;There is regular measurement and reporting as to whether those outcomes are being achieved, based on data that is made public to everyone<br /><br />&quot;Adjustments are made when the desired outcomes are not being achieved<br /><br />&quot;Contrast this with the normal regulatory model, which focuses on the rules rather than the outcomes. How often have we faced rules that simply no longer make sense? How often do we see evidence that the rules are actually achieving the desired outcome?&quot;<br /><br />(<a href=\\\"http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/\\\">http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/open-data-and-algorithmic-regulation/</a>).\\ufeff\", \n",

Makani hopes to accelerate the shift to clean, renewable energy by developing energy kites, a new type of wind turbine. By building just the tip of a wind turbine blade (which makes most of the energy), we think it\\u2019s possible for Makani\\u2019s energy kite to generate 50% more energy while eliminating 90% of the materials used. And this could happen at half the cost of conventional wind turbines. Replacing tons of steel and concrete with smart software and advanced materials could dramatically change the calculus of wind power.<br /><br />We\\u2019ve made a lot of progress since joining Google[x] last year\\u2014improving how we launch and land, how to fly in variable wind conditions, how to generate power more efficiently, and many other aspects of the system. Our new energy kite will reach higher, fly longer and generate 20 times more energy than earlier versions. We&#39;re moving from our proof of concept phase to a stage where we want to test ourselves against the &quot;real world&quot; challenges we&#39;ll face if we want to bring electricity to people.<br /><br />So we\\u2019re hoping to start a pilot project next year on the island of Hawaii to test long-duration flights of our new energy kite for the first time, and to learn as much as much as possible\\u2014e.g. how much power we generate at different wind speeds and how to maintain the kite over long periods of time.\\u00a0<br /><br />Makani has a long history with Hawaii\\u2014our name is inspired by Hawaiian winds and we tested an early prototype of our kite there in 2008\\u2014and we\\u2019ve found a great site there with ideal wind conditions. We\\u2019re still in the early stages, but we hope that if the pilot project is successful, we\\u2019ll be a step closer to making clean energy more accessible.\\ufeff\", \n",

Jascha Franklin Hodge in Boston, Teresa Reno Webber in Louisville, Beth Niblock in Detroit, and Rick Cole,  Peter Marx, and Abhi Nemani in LA all come to mind. There are so many people in government who are hungry for new ways of doing things. They went into public service to make a difference, and they want help from private sector partners who are working with 21st century technology and business models.<br /><br />The outside game has largely consisted of nonprofits like Code for America and Datakind, but now increasingly we are seeing commercial companies who are bringing new ways of thinking to government projects. Venture capital adds welcome fuel to the mix.<br /><br />I am so excited to be working with <span class=\\\"proflinkWrapper\\\"><span class=\\\"proflinkPrefix\\\">+</span>*****</span> on this fund!\\ufeff\", \n",

We have a delivery crisis!&quot; \\u00a0We endlessly promote new policies that are supposed to fix everything, but pay little attention to what it will take to actually implement them.<br /><br />In an In an interview with Charlie Rose, Steven Brill said something similar about the failure of <a href=\\\"http://healthcare.gov\\\">healthcare.gov</a> in the disconnect between policy and implementation: \\u201cThe way they managed this program, it was almost as if they thought that actual governing, the nuts and bolts of governing, is for peons. And they are policy people.\\u201d (See <a href=\\\"http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj\\\">http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj</a>)<br /><br />In this particular case, there is little or no teacher training, no supervision:\\u00a0<br /><br />&quot;The trouble always starts when teachers are told to put innovative ideas into practice without much guidance on how to do it. In the hands of unprepared teachers, the reforms turn to nonsense, perplexing students more than helping them....&quot;<br /><br />&quot;With the Common Core, teachers are once more being asked to unlearn an old approach and learn an entirely new one, essentially on their own. Training is still weak and infrequent, and principals \\u2014 who are no more skilled at math than their teachers \\u2014 remain unprepared to offer support. Textbooks, once again, have received only surface adjustments, despite the shiny Common Core labels that decorate their covers.&quot;<br /><br />By contrast, Japan took not just the ideas of how to teach math better, but also put those ideas carefully and thoroughly into practice. \\u00a0<br /><br />&quot;In Japan, teachers had always depended on jugyokenkyu, which translates literally as \\u201clesson study,\\u201d a set of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft. A teacher first plans lessons, then teaches in front of an audience of students and other teachers along with at least one university observer. Then the observers talk with the teacher about what has just taken place. Each public lesson poses a hypothesis, a new idea about how to help children learn. And each discussion offers a chance to determine whether it worked. Without jugyokenkyu, it was no wonder the American teachers\\u2019 work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers. Without jugyokenyku, Takahashi never would have learned to teach at all. Neither, certainly, would the rest of Japan\\u2019s teachers.&quot;<br /><br />This is a must-read piece if you care about education, or even just, if like many parents, you are struggling to help your own children make up for the terrible math education they are getting in school.\\ufeff\", \n",
